      When managing tasks:

      1. Only one task should be in progress at a time
      2. Task files must be included in every commit that relates to the task
      3. Status management:
         - Mark as "Doing" when starting a task
         - Mark as "Done" when completing a task
         - Otherwise, keep as "To Do"
      4. Task file format:
         ```md
         ---
         Name: Task name
         Status: [To Do|Doing|Done]
         ---
