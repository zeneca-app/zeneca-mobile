# Navigation Structure Reference Rule

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When answering questions about app navigation, routing, or screen organization
- When modifications to navigation structure are requested
- When new screens or routes need to be added

## Requirements
- Always consult docs/navigation-structure.md before providing navigation-related answers
- Verify route groups and their purposes (authenticated, onboarding, etc.)
- Check existing navigation patterns and hierarchy
- Confirm dynamic routes and their parameter requirements
- Validate modal screen implementations
- Ensure layout file (_layout.tsx) implications are considered

## Examples

<example>
Question: "How do I add a new screen for transaction history?"
Response: "According to navigation-structure.md, authenticated screens are in the (authenticated) route group. Transaction-related screens follow a pattern similar to order-history. We should add it under (authenticated)/transactions/_layout.tsx..."
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Question: "Where should I put the new settings screen?"
Response: "You can just create a settings.tsx file in the app folder"
Explanation: Failed to consult navigation-structure.md which would show proper organization under (authenticated) group
</example>

<critical>
- NEVER suggest navigation changes without checking navigation-structure.md
- ALWAYS verify route group organization before providing guidance
- ENSURE new routes follow existing patterns and hierarchy
