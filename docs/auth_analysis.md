# Authentication Flow Analysis Document
## 1. Authentication Architecture Overview

The application implements a multi-layered authentication system with the following components:

### 1.1 Authentication Providers

- **Privy Authentication** (`@privy-io/expo`): Primary authentication provider that handles OAuth and email-based authentication
  - Provides `isReady`, `user`, `login`, and `logout` functionality
  - Manages authentication state and user identity
  - Uses a custom secure storage adapter for token persistence

- **Backend Authentication**: Secondary verification with the app's backend API
  - Validates Privy user with backend and creates/retrieves app-specific user profile
  - Uses TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
  - Stores authentication token for API requests

- **Local State Management**: Zustand store for persisting user state
  - Persists authenticated user data across app sessions
  - Provides actions for setting, fetching, and resetting user
  - Uses secure storage for sensitive data

### 1.2 Authentication Flow Layers

1. **Privy Authentication Layer**:
   - Handles OAuth (Google) and email authentication
   - Manages authentication tokens and user identity
   - Provides authentication state through React context

2. **Backend Verification Layer**:
   - Validates Privy user with backend API
   - Creates or retrieves app-specific user profile
   - Establishes session with backend services
   - Stores authentication token for subsequent API requests

3. **Local State Persistence**:
   - Stores authenticated user data in Zustand store
   - Persists authentication state across app sessions
   - Provides user data to components throughout the app

## 2. Authentication Components and Their Roles

### 2.1 Core Authentication Components

#### 2.1.1 `AwaitPrivyProvider` Component

- **Location**: `src/components/AwaitPrivyProvider.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Acts as a gatekeeper for the entire app

## 4. Authentication Flow Process

### 4.1 Initial App Load

1. App starts with `AppIndex` component in `src/index.tsx`
2. Loads fonts and hides splash screen
3. Sets up navigation container and providers:
   - `NavigationContainer`: Provides navigation context
   - `Providers`: Sets up all app providers
   - `StatusBar`: Configures status bar
   - `MainNavigation`: Defines navigation structure
4. Within `Providers`, the following are initialized:
   - `GestureHandlerRootView`: For gesture handling
   - `PrivyProvider`: For authentication
   - `PostHogProvider`: For analytics
   - `SafeAreaProvider`: For safe area handling
   - `BottomSheetModalProvider`: For bottom sheets
   - `WagmiProvider`: For blockchain integration
   - `PersistQueryClientProvider`: For query persistence
   - `AwaitPrivyProvider`: For authentication state management

### 4.2 Authentication State Resolution

1. `AwaitPrivyProvider` initializes with `isReady: false`
2. Waits for Privy to be ready (`isPrivyReady`)
3. Once Privy is ready, checks for Privy user:
   - If no Privy user: Sets `isReady: true`, clears user store, shows login screens
   - If Privy user exists: Checks for backend user in store
   - If both exist: Sets `isReady: true`, shows authenticated screens
   - If Privy user exists but no backend user: Fetches from backend API
4. The component uses a complex `useEffect` with multiple dependencies:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (!isPrivyReady) return;

     // Not authenticated if no privyUser
     if (!privyUser) {
       setUser(undefined);
       setIsReady(true);
       return;
     }

     // Already authenticated if both exist
     if (privyUser && user) {
       setIsReady(true);
       return;
     }

     // fetch user again if we are authenticated
     if (userData) {
       setUser(userData);
       setIsReady(true);
       return;
     }

     // Handle error case - clear user and logout
     if (error) {
       setUser(undefined);
       handleLogout()
       setIsReady(true);
       return;
     }

     // If we have privyUser but no user data, trigger fetch
     if (shouldFetchUser) {
       refetch();
     }
   }, [
     isPrivyReady,
     privyUser,
     user,
     userData,
     error,
     shouldFetchUser,
     setUser,
     logout
   ]);
   ```

### 4.3 Backend User Verification

1. Fetches user data from backend using TanStack Query:
   ```typescript
   const {
     data: userData,
     error,
     refetch
   } = useQuery({
     ...usersMeOptions({ client }),
     enabled: shouldFetchUser,
     retry: 1
   });
   ```
2. On success: Sets user in store, sets `isReady: true`
3. On error: Clears user store, logs out from Privy, sets `isReady: true`
4. Error handling is implemented with a callback:
   ```typescript
   const handleLogout = useCallback(async () => {
     console.error(
       "Error fetching user data from backend",
       privyUser?.id,
       "\nPerforming Privy Logout\n",
       error
     );
     await logout();
   }, [privyUser?.id, error, logout]);
   ```

### 4.4 User Login Process

1. User navigates to `LoginOptions` screen
2. Selects authentication method (email or Google)
3. For Google OAuth:
   - Calls Privy's `login({ provider: "google" })`
   - On success, creates/retrieves backend user:
     ```typescript
     await loginLoginOrCreate({
       headers: {
         Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
       },
       body: {
         email: account.email,
         has_third_party_auth: true,
         wallet: {
           address: userAddress as `0x${string}`,
           smart_account_address: smartAccount?.account
             ?.address as `0x${string}`,
         },
       },
     });
     ```
   - Stores authentication token in secure storage:
     ```typescript
     await SecureStore.setItemAsync(`token-${userAddress}`, accessToken!);
     ```
   - Navigates to `Home` screen
4. For Email:
   - Navigates to `LoginWithEmail` screen
   - User enters email
   - Navigates to `EmailOtpValidation` for verification
   - On success, follows similar backend verification process

## 5. Authentication State Management

### 5.1 State Variables and Conditions

- `isPrivyReady`: Indicates if Privy has initialized
- `privyUser`: Privy user object if authenticated
- `user`: Backend user object from store
- `isReady`: Indicates if authentication state is resolved
- `shouldFetchUser`: Condition to fetch backend user (`!!privyUser && !user && isPrivyReady`)
- `userData`: Backend user data from API
- `error`: Error from backend API call

### 5.2 State Transitions

1. **Initial State**: `isReady: false`, showing loading animation
   - App starts with `AwaitPrivyProvider` showing `LogoAnimation`
   - Waits for Privy to initialize (`isPrivyReady`)

2. **Unauthenticated State**: `isReady: true`, `privyUser: null`, `user: null`
   - Privy is ready but no user is authenticated
   - Shows login screens
   - User can initiate authentication

3. **Partially Authenticated State**: `isReady: false`, `privyUser: exists`, `user: null`
   - User authenticated with Privy but not yet with backend
   - Fetching user data from backend
   - Still showing loading animation

4. **Fully Authenticated State**: `isReady: true`, `privyUser: exists`, `user: exists`
   - User authenticated with both Privy and backend
   - Shows authenticated screens
   - User can access protected features

5. **Error State**: `isReady: true`, `privyUser: null`, `user: null` (after logout)
   - Error occurred during backend authentication
   - Forced logout from Privy
   - Shows login screens
   - No specific error feedback to user

## 6. Authentication Issues and Challenges

### 6.1 Current Implementation Issues

1. **Boolean State Limitation**:
   - Using `isReady` boolean doesn't capture all authentication states
   - No distinction between different authentication phases
   - Limited ability to show appropriate UI for each state

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Forces logout on any backend error without retry options
   - No distinction between different types of errors (network, validation, server)
   - Limited error reporting (only console.error)
   - No user feedback for authentication failures

3. **Race Conditions**:
   - Complex effect dependencies could lead to race conditions
   - Multiple return statements in effect make flow hard to follow
   - No clear state machine for transitions

4. **Tight Coupling**:
   - Authentication logic tightly coupled with provider component
   - Direct dependencies on Privy and user store
   - Limited separation of concerns

5. **Limited User Feedback**:
   - No specific error messaging or recovery options
   - Only shows `LogoAnimation` for all non-ready states
   - No progress indicators for authentication steps

### 6.2 Edge Cases Not Handled Well

1. **Network Failures**:
   - No specific handling for network failures vs. authentication failures
   - No retry mechanism for transient network issues
   - Forces logout on any backend error

2. **Token Expiration**:
   - No clear token refresh mechanism
   - No handling of token expiration during app use
   - No automatic re-authentication

3. **Partial Authentication**:
   - Limited handling of state where Privy succeeds but backend fails
   - No recovery path except full re-authentication
   - No preservation of authentication progress

4. **Concurrent Authentication**:
   - No protection against concurrent authentication attempts
   - No locking mechanism during authentication process
   - Potential for race conditions with multiple auth attempts

5. **App Backgrounding**:
   - No specific handling for authentication during app backgrounding
   - Potential for interrupted authentication flows
   - No resumption of authentication process

## 7. Route Protection and Navigation

### 7.1 Current Route Protection

- Initial route in `MainNavigation` is conditionally set based on user state:
  ```typescript
  <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName={!user ? "Login" : "Home"}>
  ```
- No explicit route protection for authenticated routes
- No prevention of direct navigation to protected routes
- Navigation after authentication handled in login components
- No deep linking protection

### 7.2 Navigation After Authentication Events

- After successful login: Navigates to `Home` screen
  ```typescript
  navigation.navigate("Home");
  ```
- After logout: `AwaitPrivyProvider` sets `isReady: true` with no user, showing login screens
- No preservation of intended destination after authentication
- No handling of deep links that require authentication

## 8. Authentication Data Flow

### 8.1 Data Flow During Login

1. User credentials → Privy Authentication
   - User provides credentials (email, Google account)
   - Privy handles authentication and returns user object

2. Privy token → Backend Authentication
   - Privy provides access token
   - Token used for backend API authentication
   - Backend validates token and creates/retrieves user

3. Backend user data → User Store
   - Backend returns user data
   - Data stored in Zustand store
   - Token stored in secure storage

4. Authentication state → Navigation
   - Authentication state updated
   - Navigation redirects to authenticated routes
   - User can access protected features

### 8.2 Data Flow During Logout

1. Logout action → Privy logout
   - User initiates logout or error forces logout
   - Privy logout called to end session

2. Privy logout → Clear user store
   - Privy session ended
   - User store reset to initial state
   - Token removed from secure storage

3. Clear user store → Navigation to login screens
   - Authentication state updated
   - Navigation redirects to login screens
   - User sees unauthenticated UI

## 9. Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the analysis, the authentication system would benefit from:

1. **State Machine Implementation**:
   - Replace boolean `isReady` with explicit authentication states
   - Define clear state transitions
   - Handle each state with appropriate UI
   - Example states: INITIALIZING, UNAUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATING, AUTHENTICATED, ERROR

2. **Centralized Authentication Context**:
   - Extract authentication logic from `AwaitPrivyProvider`
   - Create dedicated AuthContext
   - Provide authentication state and methods
   - Simplify component dependencies

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Add retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
   - Categorize errors (network, authentication, server)
   - Provide specific error messaging
   - Implement Sentry integration for error reporting

4. **Token Management**:
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanism
   - Handle token expiration gracefully
   - Store tokens securely with encryption
   - Implement proper cleanup on logout

5. **Protected Route Component**:
   - Create a dedicated component for route protection
   - Check authentication state before rendering
   - Redirect unauthenticated users to login
   - Preserve intended destination

6. **Consistent Navigation**:
   - Standardize navigation after authentication events
   - Handle deep linking properly
   - Implement navigation guards
   - Preserve navigation state during authentication

7. **User Feedback**:
   - Improve loading and error states with clear user feedback
   - Show progress indicators for authentication steps
   - Provide recovery options for authentication failures
   - Implement proper error messages

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Implement unit tests for authentication components
   - Test all authentication scenarios
   - Validate state transitions
   - Test edge cases like network failures and token expiration

These improvements would create a more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly authentication system that handles edge cases properly and provides a better user experience.

## 10. Wallet Integration Analysis

### 10.1 Wallet Architecture Overview

The application implements a wallet system deeply integrated with the authentication flow, using the following components:

- **Privy Embedded Wallet**: Primary wallet provider that creates and manages user wallets
  - Provided by `@privy-io/expo` package
  - Creates non-custodial wallets tied to user authentication
  - Manages wallet state and provider access

- **Smart Account Integration**: Account abstraction layer built on top of EOA wallets
  - Uses Permissionless.js library for smart account creation
  - Implements Simple Account standard (ERC-4337)
  - Provides gasless transactions through Pimlico paymaster

- **Blockchain Integration**: Multi-chain support through Wagmi and Viem
  - Configured for multiple networks (Sepolia, Base Sepolia, Base)
  - Provides RPC connections and transaction handling
  - Manages wallet connections to blockchain networks

### 10.2 Wallet Creation and Management Flow

#### 10.2.1 Wallet Creation During Authentication

The wallet creation process is tightly coupled with the authentication flow:

1. **Authentication Initiation**:
   - User authenticates via Privy (Google OAuth or email)
   - Privy creates a user identity

2. **Embedded Wallet Creation**:
   - After successful authentication, the app checks for an existing wallet
   - If no wallet exists, it creates a new embedded wallet:
     ```typescript
     if (isNotCreated(wallet)) {
       await wallet.create!();
     }
     ```
   - The wallet is non-custodial and controlled by the user

3. **Smart Account Creation**:
   - After wallet creation, a smart account is created:
     ```typescript
     const smartAccount = await getPimlicoSmartAccountClient(
       userAddress as `0x${string}`,
       chain,
       wallet,
     );
     ```
   - Uses the embedded wallet as the owner/signer
   - Creates a counterfactual smart account address

4. **Backend Registration**:
   - Both the EOA wallet address and smart account address are registered with the backend:
     ```typescript
     await loginLoginOrCreate({
       // ...
       body: {
         email: account.email,
         has_third_party_auth: true,
         wallet: {
           address: userAddress as `0x${string}`,
           smart_account_address: smartAccount?.account?.address as `0x${string}`,
         },
       },
     });
     ```
   - Links the wallet addresses to the user profile

#### 10.2.2 Wallet Provider Implementation

The wallet provider is implemented using Privy's embedded wallet:

1. **Provider Initialization**:
   - Initialized in the `Providers` component with Privy configuration
   - Configured with app ID and client ID from environment variables
   - Uses custom secure storage adapter for key persistence

2. **Wallet State Management**:
   - Managed through `useEmbeddedWallet` hook
   - Provides wallet state and methods for wallet operations
   - Handles wallet creation, connection, and signing

3. **Provider Access**:
   - Access to the wallet provider is abstracted through utility functions:
     ```typescript
     const walletClient = getWalletClient(address, chain, wallet);
     ```
   - Provides standardized interface for wallet operations

### 10.3 Smart Account Integration

The application uses account abstraction to enhance user experience:

#### 10.3.1 Smart Account Creation

1. **Smart Account Factory**:
   - Uses a deployed factory contract to create smart accounts
   - Implements the Simple Account standard (ERC-4337)
   - Creates counterfactual addresses before deployment

2. **Smart Account Client**:
   - Created using Permissionless.js library:
     ```typescript
     return createSmartAccountClient({
       account: simpleAccount,
       entryPoint: entryPoint07Address,
       chain: currentEnv.CHAIN,
       bundlerTransport: http(currentEnv.PAYMASTER),
       middleware: {
         gasPrice: async () => (await pimlicoBundlerClient().getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast,
         sponsorUserOperation: paymasterClient().sponsorUserOperation,
       },
     });
     ```
   - Configures bundler and paymaster for transaction handling
   - Provides methods for sending transactions

3. **Transaction Handling**:
   - Transactions are sent through the smart account client
   - Bundled and sponsored by Pimlico services
   - Allows for gasless transactions and batched operations

#### 10.3.2 Wallet Signer Implementation

The application implements custom signers to bridge between Privy and Viem:

1. **Light Signer**:
   - Implements a minimal signer interface for message signing:
     ```typescript
     export const getLightSigner = (
       address: string,
       chain: Chain,
       provider: PrivyEmbeddedWalletProvider,
     ) => {
       return {
         async getAddress() {
           return address!;
         },
         async signMessage(message: string) {
           // Implementation
         },
       };
     };
     ```
   - Used for simple signing operations

2. **Wallet Client**:
   - Creates a Viem wallet client from the Privy provider:
     ```typescript
     export const getWalletClient = (
       ownerAddress: string,
       chain: Chain,
       wallet: EmbeddedWalletState,
     ) => {
       return createWalletClient({
         account: ownerAddress as `0x${string}`,
         chain,
         transport: custom({
           async request({ method, params }) {
             return (await wallet.getProvider!()).request({ method, params });
           },
         }),
       });
     };
     ```
   - Bridges between Privy's provider interface and Viem's wallet client
   - Handles RPC method forwarding

### 10.4 Wallet-Authentication Relationship

The relationship between wallet and authentication is bidirectional:

#### 10.4.1 Authentication-to-Wallet Flow

1. **Identity-First Approach**:
   - Authentication establishes user identity first
   - Wallet is created/connected after successful authentication
   - Wallet is tied to the authenticated user identity

2. **Wallet Creation Trigger**:
   - Triggered in the `handleConnection` function after authentication
   - Only proceeds if authentication is successful
   - Creates wallet if it doesn't exist

3. **Session Management**:
   - Authentication session and wallet session are managed together
   - Logout clears both authentication and wallet state
   - Re-authentication reconnects to existing wallet

#### 10.4.2 Wallet-to-Backend Synchronization

1. **Wallet Registration**:
   - Wallet addresses are registered with backend during authentication
   - Both EOA and smart account addresses are stored
   - Backend maintains the association between user and wallets

2. **Token Storage**:
   - Authentication token is stored with wallet address as key:
     ```typescript
     await SecureStore.setItemAsync(`token-${userAddress}`, accessToken!);
     ```
   - Creates a link between authentication token and wallet

3. **User Profile Update**:
   - User profile is updated with wallet information
   - Enables wallet-based features and permissions
   - Allows for wallet-based authentication in future sessions

### 10.5 Security Considerations

The wallet integration includes several security considerations:

#### 10.5.1 Key Management

1. **Secure Storage**:
   - Private keys are stored in device secure storage
   - Uses `MyPermissiveSecureStorageAdapter` for Privy integration
   - Implements platform-specific secure storage mechanisms

2. **Non-Custodial Design**:
   - User maintains control of their private keys
   - Keys never leave the device
   - Application cannot access raw private keys

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Relies on Privy's recovery mechanisms
   - Tied to authentication method (email, Google)
   - No separate seed phrase management

#### 10.5.2 Transaction Security

1. **Signature Verification**:
   - All transactions require user signature
   - Signatures are verified on-chain
   - Smart account enforces owner authorization

2. **Smart Contract Security**:
   - Uses audited smart account implementations
   - Follows ERC-4337 standard for account abstraction
   - Implements counterfactual addresses for security

3. **RPC Security**:
   - Uses secure RPC endpoints
   - Implements proper error handling for RPC calls
   - Validates responses from RPC providers

#### 10.5.3 Authentication-Wallet Binding

1. **Strict Binding**:
   - Wallet is strictly bound to authenticated user
   - Cannot use wallet without authentication
   - Authentication state controls wallet access

2. **Token Security**:
   - Authentication tokens stored with wallet address as key
   - Tokens stored in secure storage
   - Token access requires device access

3. **Session Management**:
   - Wallet session tied to authentication session
   - Logout clears both sessions
   - Re-authentication required for wallet access

### 10.6 Wallet Integration Challenges

The current wallet integration faces several challenges:

1. **Complex Dependency Chain**:
   - Relies on multiple libraries (Privy, Viem, Permissionless.js)
   - Version compatibility issues between libraries
   - Complex upgrade path for wallet components

## 11. KYC Verification Flow

### 11.1 KYC Architecture Overview

The application implements a structured Know Your Customer (KYC) verification system that integrates with the authentication flow, using the following components:

- **Onboarding State Management**: Tracks user progress through the KYC process
  - Uses Zustand store (`useKYCStatusStore`) for state persistence
  - Defines clear onboarding status progression
  - Manages KYC verification status separately from authentication

- **Third-Party KYC Provider**: AiPrise integration for identity verification
  - Embedded via `AiPriseFrame` component
  - Handles document scanning and verification
  - Provides callbacks for success and failure scenarios

- **Backend Verification Layer**: API endpoints for KYC status management
  - Validates and updates user KYC status
  - Enforces sequential progression through onboarding steps
  - Stores verification results and status

### 11.2 KYC Status and States

#### 11.2.1 Onboarding Status Progression

The KYC flow follows a defined progression of states:

1. **NAMES_STEP**: Initial step collecting user's first and last name
2. **COUNTRY_STEP**: Collection of user's country information
3. **ADDRESS_STEP**: Collection of detailed address information
4. **KYC_PROVIDER_STEP**: Integration with third-party KYC provider

These states are defined in an enum:
```typescript
export enum OnboardingStatus {
    NAMES_STEP = "NAMES_STEP",
    COUNTRY_STEP = "COUNTRY_STEP",
    ADDRESS_STEP = "ADDRESS_STEP",
    KYC_PROVIDER_STEP = "KYC_PROVIDER_STEP",
}
```

#### 11.2.2 KYC Verification Status

Separate from onboarding status, the application tracks KYC verification status:

```typescript
interface KYCStatusState {
  obStatus?: OnboardingStatus;
  kycStatus?: KYCStatus;
  isVerifying: boolean;
  isVerified: boolean;
}
```

The `kycStatus` can be one of the following (from the API types):
- `NOT_STARTED`: User has not begun KYC verification
- `IN_PROGRESS`: User has started but not completed verification
- `PENDING_REVIEW`: Verification submitted and awaiting review
- `APPROVED`: Verification approved
- `REJECTED`: Verification rejected

            obStatus: status,
            isVerifying: status === "KYC_PROVIDER_STEP",
          })),
        setKycStatus: (status: KYCStatus) =>
          set(() => ({
            kycStatus: status,
            isVerified: status !== "NOT_STARTED",
          })),
        reset: () => set(initialState),
      }),
      {
        name: "kyc-status-storage",

  error: Error | null;
  retryCount: number;
  canProceedToKYC: boolean;
  
  // Actions
  startVerification: () => void;
  handleVerificationSuccess: () => void;
  handleVerificationFailure: (error: Error) => void;
  redirectToKYC: () => void;
  completeKYC: (data: any) => void;
  submitKYCData: (data: any) => Promise<void>;
  retry: () => void;
}
```

This state machine:
- Manages the transition to KYC verification
- Handles verification status checks
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provides error handling and recovery

### 11.5 KYC Integration with Authentication

Based on the comparison with industry best practices, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **Enhance MFA Options**:
   - Implement FIDO2/WebAuthn support for hardware security keys.
   - Add additional second-factor options beyond email OTP.
   - Consider risk-based authentication for sensitive operations.

2. **Improve Token Management**:
   - Implement and document token refresh mechanisms.
   - Add explicit token revocation capabilities.
   - Implement PKCE for OAuth flows if not already present.

3. **Strengthen State Management**:
   - Replace boolean flags with explicit state machine.
   - Simplify complex conditional logic in authentication components.
   - Improve handling of edge cases and error scenarios.

4. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Implement rate limiting for failed authentication attempts.
   - Improve error categorization and user feedback.
   - Integrate with monitoring systems for authentication failures.

5. **Improve Session Security**:
   - Implement and document session timeout policies.
   - Add protection against session fixation and hijacking.
   - Implement secure session termination across devices.

6. **Document Security Measures**:
   - Create explicit security documentation for authentication components.
   - Conduct and document security testing for authentication flows.
   - Perform threat modeling for authentication system.

These recommendations align with industry best practices and would significantly enhance the security and reliability of the authentication system while maintaining usability.

Areas to Consider Adding
1. Offline Authentication Behavior
While you mention offline authentication as a future consideration, more details on the current behavior would be helpful:
How the app behaves when authentication is attempted offline
Caching strategies for authentication tokens
Revalidation process when coming back online
User experience during offline/online transitions
2. Performance Analysis
Consider adding metrics or observations about authentication performance:
Authentication flow latency measurements
Impact of authentication on app startup time
Memory usage during authentication processes
Potential performance bottlenecks in the current implementation
3. Security Analysis
While security is mentioned in various sections, a dedicated security analysis would strengthen the document:
Token storage security assessment
Authentication flow vulnerabilities
Session management security
Potential attack vectors and mitigations
4. Analytics and Monitoring
Add information about how authentication events are tracked:
What authentication events are logged
How authentication failures are monitored
Analytics integration for authentication flows
Key metrics tracked for authentication health
5. Cross-Platform Considerations
Since this is a mobile app, consider adding platform-specific authentication considerations:
iOS vs Android authentication differences
Platform-specific secure storage implementations
Biometric authentication integration possibilities
Platform-specific performance considerations
6. Dependency Analysis
A deeper analysis of external dependencies would be valuable:
Privy SDK version and feature compatibility
Critical dependencies for authentication
Potential upgrade paths for authentication libraries
Risk assessment for third-party authentication dependencies
